This repository contains a library of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) for building, testing, and learning about [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP).

Both specifications are fairly new and changing quickly, so you MUST always check the latest official documentation when working with either Agent Skills or MCP.
