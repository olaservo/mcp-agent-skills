This repository contains a library of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) for building, testing, and learning about [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP).

Both specifications are fairly new and changing quickly, so you MUST always check the latest official documentation when working with either Agent Skills or MCP.

## Available Skills

- **mcp-server-ts**: Build MCP servers in TypeScript with tools, resources, and prompts
- **mcp-client-ts**: Build MCP clients in TypeScript to connect to MCP servers
- **mcp-apps-ts**: Build interactive HTML UIs for MCP tools using the experimental MCP Apps extension (SEP-1865)

Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` with instructions, a `manifest.json` cataloging snippets, reference documentation, and code snippets organized by category.
